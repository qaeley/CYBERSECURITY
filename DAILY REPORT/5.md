## 📅 Progress Report: The XOR Deep Dive

### ⚡ The XOR Challenge (Introduction to Cryptography)
* **Status:** Completed ✅
* **Time Investment:** ~2 Hours
* **The Struggle:** Attempted to use the `pwntools` library for the `xor()` function. Faced a major roadblock where the `unicorn` dependency failed to build due to a `cmake` subprocess error (caused by the Python 3.14 + macOS 13 version mismatch).
* **The Pivot:** Instead of getting stuck on environment issues, I bypassed the library and implemented a **Manual XOR logic** using Python's built-in bitwise `^` operator.

### 🛠️ New Tools & Logic Added to Arsenal
* **List Management:** Mastered the **`.append()`** method to dynamically build result arrays inside loops.
* **String Reconstruction:** Utilized **`.join()`** to "glue" character arrays back into readable strings—a vital bridge in the crypto workflow.
* **String Formatting:** Implemented **f-strings** with double-brace escaping `f"crypto{{{flag}}}"` to output flags in the correct format.
* **Bitwise Logic:** Gained a fundamental understanding of how `ord()` (char to int) and `chr()` (int to char) interact with XOR.
