### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I successfully completed Cryptopals Challenge 3: Single-byte XOR cipher. I implemented a brute-force script that iterated through all 256 possible ASCII keys. By using a "space-check" heuristic (if b" " in plaintext), I was able to quickly filter through the noise and identify the correct English plaintext and its corresponding secret key (X).*


**What challenged you?**

*Nothing.*

**Key learning:**

*I mastered the concept of "Keyspace Exhaustion" for single-byte ciphers. I also deepened my understanding of how Python iterates over bytes objects as integers, allowing for direct bitwise math. Finally, I learned that searching for common ASCII characters like spaces (decimal 32) is a highly effective way to automate the detection of human-readable text during a brute-force attack.*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to other Cryptopals Challenges (Challenge 4 involves detecting XOR in a larger dataset).*
