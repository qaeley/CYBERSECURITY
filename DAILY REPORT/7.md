**Date:** Feb. 18, 2026 | **Training Day:** 7/180

### 🛠️ Technical Logic
* **Cipher Math**: Applied the property $(C \oplus P = K)$ to "leak" the key from the known `crypto{` prefix.
* **Key Cycling**: Used the **Modulo Operator (`%`)** to synchronize a short key with a long ciphertext.

### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I successfully completed the "Favorite Byte" and "You either know, XOR you don't" challenges. I was able to use Known Plaintext Attacks and custom Python scripting to effectively leak secret keys and decrypt multi-byte XOR ciphertexts.*



**What challenged you?**

*I initially struggled with key alignment; using an incomplete 7-byte key caused the flag to drift into garbage text. I also faced significant environment hurdles with Python 3.14 and CMD, specifically the 'Failed to build unicorn' error which blocked the installation of pwntools.*

**Key learning:**

*I learned how to implement a repeating-key XOR cipher using the modulo operator (%) to cycle a short key over a long ciphertext. I also mastered a 'pivoting' mindset—building a custom XOR utility to mimic library functions when installation dependencies fail on experimental Python versions.*

**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to finish the remaining tasks on introduction to cryptography*
