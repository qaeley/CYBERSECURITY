# 🛡️ CryptoHack: Introduction Challenges

This directory contains my writeups and solutions for the introductory module of CryptoHack. To ensure I am building a deep understanding of cryptography and Python, I only document challenges that meet the following criteria:

### 📋 Documentation Criteria
* **Anti-Spoiler:** The writeup explains the *logic* and *process* rather than just providing a direct answer.
* **Problem Solving:** Challenges that require significant "brain power" and critical thinking to solve.
* **Arsenal Building:** Challenges that introduced new Python concepts (e.g., bitwise operations, list manipulation, or library troubleshooting) that are applicable to future cryptographic tasks -> Will then be added to cheatsheet.
