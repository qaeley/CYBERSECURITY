### Love at First Breach
Update: Our supervisor uploaded the "Love at First Breach" challenge today. To start, I completed a TryHackMe task as an entry point; although I initially had no knowledge of the topic, through proper research I learned how to bypass website authentication using tokens, JWT, and CyberChef.

### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I successfully completed the TryHackMe task from the "Love at First Breach" challenge. I was able to use jwt.io and CyberChef to effectively analyze and manipulate authentication data.*


**What challenged you?**

*I initially struggled to understand how websites use tokens to verify user identity. Researching the structure of JWTs and learning how to modify them without breaking the format was the biggest hurdle.*


**Key learning:**

*I learned how to bypass website authentication by exploiting vulnerabilities in JSON Web Tokens. I mastered the workflow of intercepting a token, escalating user privileges in the payload, and re-encoding the data for bypass.*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to finish the remaining tasks on introduction to cryptography*
