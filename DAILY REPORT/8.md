### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I successfully completed the "Favorite Byte" and "You either know, XOR you don't" challenges from CryptoHack, along with the first challenge of Cryptopals (Hex to Base64). I effectively used Known Plaintext Attacks (KPA) to leak keys and implemented custom Python logic to handle multi-byte XOR decryptions.*


**What challenged you?**

*Nothing.*

**Key learning:**

*I mastered the implementation of repeating-key XOR ciphers using the modulo operator (`%`) for key cycling. Additionally, I reviewed and strengthened my skills in data conversion—specifically moving between Hex, Bytes, and Base64—while learning to "pivot" by creating custom local utilities when external libraries fail.*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to other Cryptopals Challenges.*
