**Date:** Feb. 14, 2026 | **Training Day:** 4/180
### 🔠 Base64 & Hex Mastery
* **Encoding Workflow:** Implemented the "Data Bridge" concept: **Hex String → Raw Bytes → Base64**.
* **Python Implementation:** Used `base64.b64encode()` to convert hex-decoded bytes into Base64 format.
* **Decoding Logic:** Applied `base64.b64decode()` to revert encoded strings back to readable bytes.
* **Troubleshooting:** Identified and fixed the `binascii.Error` by ensuring input strings are multiples of 4 (padding).

### 🔢 Mathematical Representations (RSA Prep)
* **Message to Number Theory:** Documented how cryptosystems like RSA treat text as large integers by concatenating byte values.
* **PyCryptodome Integration:** * Used `bytes_to_long()` to turn raw messages into massive base-10 integers.
    * Used `long_to_bytes()` to reverse the process and retrieve the flag from numeric ciphertext.

### 🛠️ Environment & Tooling
* **Package Management:** Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` by installing `pycryptodome` via terminal.
* **Platform Specifics:** Configured macOS/ZSH environment using `pip3` instead of the standard `pip` command.
* **VS Code Optimization:** Documented the importance of matching the **Python Interpreter** to the installation environment.

### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I've learned various tools to use in cryptography as well as using my terminal for import. Also applied the concepts of ICOMP and DLD in encoding/decoding*


**What challenged you?**

*Every time I face a lesson, everything feels new since I'm still learning the overall capabilities of python language*


**Key learning:**

*Raw bytes serve as the essential "bridge" between human-readable text, encoded strings like Base64, and the large integers used in mathematical cryptosystems..*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to XOR and finish the remaining intro lessons.*
