### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I successfully completed Cryptopals Challenge 2: Fixed XOR. I successfully built a custom XOR function using zip() and list comprehensions to perform bitwise operations on two hex-encoded buffers. This allowed me to verify the target XOR string and effectively handle binary data manipulation in Python.*


**What challenged you?**

*Nothing.*

**Key learning:**

*I reviewed and strengthened my skills in converting strings and handling byte-level operations. Specifically, I learned how to "mock" professional library functions (like pwn.xor) with my own logic and how to use .hex() and .decode() to format output for validation against challenge requirements.*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*Will proceed to other Cryptopals Challenges.*
