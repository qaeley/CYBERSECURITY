### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

*I studied the basics and learned about the different key concepts.*


**What challenged you?**

*Feeling a bit lost on implementation; focused on taking notes for now.*


**Key learning:**

*I discovered that cryptography isn't just about "scrambling" text; it is a structured process of data transformation. The good thing is, we have recently tackled this in our Discrete 2 Subject, I just need to know now the way of implementing this.*


**Tomorrow's focus:**

*I might ask our supervisor regarding resources I should use to learn cryptography.*
